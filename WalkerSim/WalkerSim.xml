  <!-- Processors are used to specify how the simulation runs, each processor typically has a Distance and Power,
       The specified distance is used to query nearby agents and power specifies how strong it will influence the
       movement direction. Not all processor types use the 'Distance' attribute.
       Processor Types:
          Flock: Keeps agents near other agents.
          Align: Will align movement direction of the agent with nearby agents.
          Avoid: Steers away from other agents.
          Group: Agents will steer towards other agents who are in the same group.
          GroupAvoid: Agents will steer away from other agents who are not a member of the same group.
          Wind: Influences the movement direction by wind direction, the wind will change over time.
          StickToRoads: Agents will steer towards close by roads.
